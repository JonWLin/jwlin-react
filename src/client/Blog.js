<h3>The Issue</h3>
<p>
One of the biggest problems I’ve noticed since entering college is how difficult it is to figure out what to eat. At least
within the scope of UC San Diego, I struggled with deciding between repetitive dining hall slop or frozen food
from the market. For many people who have to decide how to make the most of their dining dollars ( a form of
  food currency on campus ), the choice has to be a balance of nutritional value, flavor, and price point.
  </p>

  <h3>Fair Trade Agreement</h3>

  <p>In 2009, UCSD embarked on a mission to support the fair trade movement by establishing the UC San Diego Fair Trade
  Advisory Committee. In many ways, this greatly benefited producers who now had an opportunity to sell their goods
  at a large university. One famous author and journalist that advocated for similar changes is Michael Pollan.
  If you haven’t already, his article,
  <a href="http://foodwritingspring2015.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/files/2015/02/Eat-Food_Food-Defined-by-Michael-Pollan1.pdfn_.pdf">Eat Food: Food Defined</a>
  is actually really short but gives a good perspective of the “eat organic, and buy locally sourced” movement that has been
  trending lately. Although, I would say his argument is on the extreme side of this movement. For those who don’t
  want to read the article, Pollan advocates “Don’t eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food”
  and to “Avoid food products that make health claims” (1). Actually, I think the second one has some merit. I
  wouldn’t trust my food anymore if it started to make claims that I’ll be happier or have a better life by eating
  that food. Oh wait, they already do that:

  <br/>
  <br/>
  <p>I have to admit that the video is really cute and touching, but there is really nothing that defines it as a Nestle
  commercial. It might as well have been a Tide ad. These commercials and advertising campaigns can be extremely
  deceiving. All across history and in every variety of industry, companies try to relate their products to being
  “cooler”, “smarter”, “better looking”. You have to be aware of these subtle misdirections because they’re everywhere—
  ads on your social media, ads in the games you play, sponsorships in every sport, etc. </p>

  <p>
  Pollan makes a lot of solid arguments in his article, but the one I have issues with is the great-grandmother statement.
  For the record, my great-grandmother is very very Chinese—to think I would only eat simple foods recognized by
  her would leave my diets invariably boring. There are so many unique ingredients that are both healthy and delicious
  that my great-grandmother never had the chance to experience. In my opinion, it would be foolish to avoid all
  the marvelous foods available to us, especially when there are new recipes being created every day. There are
  millions of recipes and combinations waiting to be cooked—the path of learning how to cook starts with a single
  dish. As cheesy as that sounds, you can't really learn to cook without cooking.
  </p>

  <p>
  Since the start of their mission, UCSD has achieved many of their proposed goals for fair trade products. So if
  you’re buying food on campus, you have the comfort of knowing that, most likely, the production of your food
  supports real people.
  </p>

  <p>
  Although, the downside for students is the significantly increased prices of products and ingredients. I don’t
  know many people who are willing to pay $4 for a bar of chocolate. That’s not to say that nothing is the market
  is worthwhile to buy. There is just a delicate balance of food value to actual cost that I want to help students
  navigate.

  <h3>Nutritional Value</h3>

  <p>
  For the longest time, I actually thought I was picking the healthy choices. I only realized my mistakes once I took a look
  at some of the items at my nearest and dearest dining hall, Canyon Vista. I knew that I could never hope to have
  a balanced diet eating only dining hall foods.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  <img class="object-fill" src="assets/img/gyudon.png" style="width:40%; height:100%; margin-right:5%;" />
  <img class="object-fill" src="assets/img/tortellini.png" style="width:40%; height:100%;" />
  <br/>
  <br/>
  81% of the daily sodium intake value in one bowl with only beef and rice ( gyudon bowl)?! The tortellini is
  138% Saturated Fat content in a measly 10 ounces of food (10 oz = 1.25 cups). For the portion size of a side item, the tortellini
  contains more fat than you should have for the entire day--not to even mention the high cholesterol.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some may argue that the unhealthiness of the entrees can be balanced by the option to grab a salad or fruit
  instead. I wholeheartedly agree that a salad, if made well (not too much sauce and croutons), can be cheap, tasty
  and nutritious. Although, what I want to explore is how to replace the “main dishes” with something healthy,
  delicious, and available on-campus.
  </p>

  <h3>Flavor</h3>

  <p>
  Campus food is notoriously bad except for some lucky schools *cough* UCLA *cough*. I would be hard-pressed to say
  that UCSD food is above average in any way. Especially when considering the prices you pay for a single scoop
  of each item. At some points it’s simply outrageous, 2$ for a single charred bok choy?!? For those who aren’t
  familiar, many of the foods that UCSD offers can be amazingly delicious if cooked right.
  <br/>
  <br/> Some of the most amazing ingredients are actually readily available in our local markets. The staples that go
  well with the widest variety of dishes: green onions, broccoli, onions, avocado, and spinach. Definitely, don’t
  forget garlic because it goes well on just about everything.
  </p>

  <h4>Green Onion: </h4>

  <p>
  Green Onion is my absolute favorite ingredient to work with. It's light in flavor, has a nice vibrant color, and complimentary
  to so many of my favorite dishes. Any egg dish can improve greatly in color and taste with some green onions.
  Not to mention, you can sprinkle some on top of any asian rice and noodle dish. Fun fact, toss the root of the
  used green onion into a cup of water and you can grow a whole new fresh green onion!
  </p>

  <h4>Broccoli:</h4>

  <p>
  I know I know, so many people are scarred by the word broccoli since a young age. Honestly, I was among the crowd
  that feared the idea of eating broccoli until I tried cooking it myself. Now, I never understand why anyone wouldn’t
  add this simple vegetable to every meal. It’s so versatile you can cook it in just about a million ways—bake
  it, saute it, make it into a paste, add it to rice, etc. Toss with some garlic, pepper, salt, a bit of butter
  and a spritz of lemon before serving.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For just $3, you can make hundreds of different dishes with completely different flavors. Don’t ever be afraid
  to experiment a bit once you become comfortable with the ingredients! Plus you can learn a skill that you’ll
  be using for the rest of your life. How many other skills do you have that you can use every day for the rest
  of your life?
  </p>

  <h3>Price</h3>

  <p>
  If you go to school here at UCSD, I’m sure you have a list of complaints about the prices of food as long as the receipts
  of CVS. It's definitely no secret that many of the markets mark-up the prices of everything by 50%. There are
  definitely things you should buy off-campus every chance you have. Staple ingredients that should be high quality
  and long lasting in the freezer such as meat, fish, chicken, and eggs. These are important proteins that can
  last weeks if properly stored and can be cooked up with salt, pepper, and oil. The price of getting any of these
  on campus is ridiculous and the quality of the protein is not worth the price.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <h3>The Challenge</h3>

  <p>
  I think there are so many opportunities that UCSD provides us students in terms of allowing us to select how and what we
  eat. It’s all a matter of effort and time. When it comes to health and diet, I don’t think there is a limit to
  the effort we should invest in ourselves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While I’m obviously not familiar with everyone’s level of cooking experience, I strongly believe that almost
  anyone can cook. Maybe you’ve tried and failed before or you’re certain anything you try to cook will end in
  complete and utter failure. I want you to prove yourself wrong at least once. Cooking is all about being patient
  with the food, paying close attention to what you’re cooking, and practice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It took a few minutes of browsing the internet to find amazing and unique recipes with ingredients all locally
  available. There no impossible to find and expensive herb. All of the things you need are readily available.
  What are you waiting for?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Try making this dish here:

  <br/>
  <p>You can find the whole recipe article at
  <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/2018/02/herb-butter-chicken-thighs/">Budget Bytes</a>
  . This website consistently provides quality recipes at an affordable price. In most cases, some of these ingredients can
  definitely be skipped. Have fun with cooking! Play around with the recipes until you figure out how to balance
  the flavors.

  Take a picture of whatever you make—doesn’t matter if it doesn’t look like a Michelin star chef made it. Shoot
  me an email at Jwlin@ucsd.edu, leave a comment below, and I’ll post it up on this website for everyone to be
