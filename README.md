As a student studying Data Science but passionate about Computer Science, I thought it would be beneficial to learn how to implement a frontend and backend system using the best practiced methods. My goal is to write a Full-stack web application that not only loads instantly(almost) but is also well documented, aesthetically pleasing, and effectively displays my portfolio. 

I want my website to show **why** I am pursuing Data Science. I deeply appreciate any feedback or advice about my website because I know there are constant improvements and changes in the ways we code.
